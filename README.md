# FPGA
* The following project aims to simulate the working of an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) using verilog.
* We have used a single FPGA module consisting of logic tiles and switch boxes, very similar to a real FPGA.
* We use different configuration files to configure/program it to perform different operations.
* We have currently implemented a '4-bit BCD adder', '8X1 Multiplexer' and an '8-bit Universal Shift Register'.
